  <p style="font-size:2vw; color: #0a0203;">Hello my love, happy birthday!!!</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw; color: #0a0203;">I just wanted to say thank you so much for everything, iâ€™m genuinely so grateful we met because I kinda have no clue what iâ€™d do without you. You mean so much to me and I hope you know that. Every time we talk I get so freaking happy and I will admit I think of you all the time - I know you like to ask why, so let me ease your mind and answer before you can ask - well, itâ€™s because I love you, thats why I think of you all the time and enjoy every time we talk ðŸ˜‹; as much as I say I hate fortnite (yk I only hate losing) I love playing it because I only play with you, and you make the game so much better. I looooooove talking to you even if we donâ€™t have much to talk about sometimes. I love you so freaking much Sofia. I hope you have an amazing day today and I hope you get all the gifts u want ðŸ˜› have an amazing birthday darling !!</p>
